# Lottie Animation Placeholders
#
# This file serves as a placeholder for Lottie animation files.
# In a production app, these would be actual JSON animation files:
#
# - loading_animation.json (Loading spinner for children)
# - success_animation.json (Celebration animation for correct answers)
# - confetti_animation.json (Confetti effect for achievements)
# - star_animation.json (Star collection animation)
#
# For development purposes, the app will handle missing animations gracefully
# by using simple fade/scale animations or hiding the animation views.
#
# To add real Lottie animations:
# 1. Download animations from LottieFiles.com
# 2. Place JSON files in app/src/main/res/raw/
# 3. Ensure animations are child-friendly and colorful
# 4. Keep file sizes reasonable for mobile performance
