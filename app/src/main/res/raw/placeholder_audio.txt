# Audio Resource Placeholders
# 
# This file serves as a placeholder for audio resources.
# In a production app, these would be actual audio files:
#
# - click_sound.mp3 (Button click sound effect)
# - success_sound.mp3 (Success/correct answer sound)
# - error_sound.mp3 (Error/wrong answer sound)
# - celebration_sound.mp3 (Level completion celebration)
# - background_music.mp3 (Gentle background music for children)
#
# For development purposes, the app will handle missing audio gracefully
# by using system sounds or silent operation.
#
# To add real audio files:
# 1. Place audio files in app/src/main/res/raw/
# 2. Use formats: MP3, OGG, or WAV
# 3. Keep file sizes small for mobile optimization
# 4. Ensure audio is child-appropriate and not too loud
